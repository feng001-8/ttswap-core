# ISignatureTransfer
Handles ERC20 token transfers through signature based actions

*Requires user's token approval on the Permit2 contract*


## Functions
### nonceBitmap

A map from token owner address and a caller specified word index to a bitmap. Used to set bits in the bitmap to prevent against signature replay protection

*Uses unordered nonces so that permit messages do not need to be spent in a certain order*

*The mapping is indexed first by the token owner, then by an index specified in the nonce*

*It returns a uint256 bitmap*

*The index, or wordPosition is capped at type(uint248).max*


```solidity
function nonceBitmap(address, uint256) external view returns (uint256);
```

### permitTransferFrom

Transfers a token using a signed permit message

*Reverts if the requested amount is greater than the permitted signed amount*


```solidity
function permitTransferFrom(
    PermitTransferFrom memory permit,
    SignatureTransferDetails calldata transferDetails,
    address owner,
    bytes calldata signature
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`permit`|`PermitTransferFrom`|The permit data signed over by the owner|
|`transferDetails`|`SignatureTransferDetails`|The spender's requested transfer details for the permitted token|
|`owner`|`address`|The owner of the tokens to transfer|
|`signature`|`bytes`|The signature to verify|


### permitWitnessTransferFrom

Transfers a token using a signed permit message

Includes extra data provided by the caller to verify signature over

*The witness type string must follow EIP712 ordering of nested structs and must include the TokenPermissions type definition*

*Reverts if the requested amount is greater than the permitted signed amount*


```solidity
function permitWitnessTransferFrom(
    PermitTransferFrom memory permit,
    SignatureTransferDetails calldata transferDetails,
    address owner,
    bytes32 witness,
    string calldata witnessTypeString,
    bytes calldata signature
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`permit`|`PermitTransferFrom`|The permit data signed over by the owner|
|`transferDetails`|`SignatureTransferDetails`|The spender's requested transfer details for the permitted token|
|`owner`|`address`|The owner of the tokens to transfer|
|`witness`|`bytes32`|Extra data to include when checking the user signature|
|`witnessTypeString`|`string`|The EIP-712 type definition for remaining string stub of the typehash|
|`signature`|`bytes`|The signature to verify|


### permitTransferFrom

Transfers multiple tokens using a signed permit message


```solidity
function permitTransferFrom(
    PermitBatchTransferFrom memory permit,
    SignatureTransferDetails[] calldata transferDetails,
    address owner,
    bytes calldata signature
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`permit`|`PermitBatchTransferFrom`|The permit data signed over by the owner|
|`transferDetails`|`SignatureTransferDetails[]`|Specifies the recipient and requested amount for the token transfer|
|`owner`|`address`|The owner of the tokens to transfer|
|`signature`|`bytes`|The signature to verify|


### permitWitnessTransferFrom

Transfers multiple tokens using a signed permit message

Includes extra data provided by the caller to verify signature over

*The witness type string must follow EIP712 ordering of nested structs and must include the TokenPermissions type definition*


```solidity
function permitWitnessTransferFrom(
    PermitBatchTransferFrom memory permit,
    SignatureTransferDetails[] calldata transferDetails,
    address owner,
    bytes32 witness,
    string calldata witnessTypeString,
    bytes calldata signature
) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`permit`|`PermitBatchTransferFrom`|The permit data signed over by the owner|
|`transferDetails`|`SignatureTransferDetails[]`|Specifies the recipient and requested amount for the token transfer|
|`owner`|`address`|The owner of the tokens to transfer|
|`witness`|`bytes32`|Extra data to include when checking the user signature|
|`witnessTypeString`|`string`|The EIP-712 type definition for remaining string stub of the typehash|
|`signature`|`bytes`|The signature to verify|


### invalidateUnorderedNonces

Invalidates the bits specified in mask for the bitmap at the word position

*The wordPos is maxed at type(uint248).max*


```solidity
function invalidateUnorderedNonces(uint256 wordPos, uint256 mask) external;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`wordPos`|`uint256`|A number to index the nonceBitmap at|
|`mask`|`uint256`|A bitmap masked against msg.sender's current bitmap at the word position|


## Events
### UnorderedNonceInvalidation
Emits an event when the owner successfully invalidates an unordered nonce.


```solidity
event UnorderedNonceInvalidation(address indexed owner, uint256 word, uint256 mask);
```

## Errors
### InvalidAmount
Thrown when the requested amount for a transfer is larger than the permissioned amount


```solidity
error InvalidAmount(uint256 maxAmount);
```

**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`maxAmount`|`uint256`|The maximum amount a spender can request to transfer|

### LengthMismatch
Thrown when the number of tokens permissioned to a spender does not match the number of tokens being transferred

*If the spender does not need to transfer the number of tokens permitted, the spender can request amount 0 to be transferred*


```solidity
error LengthMismatch();
```

## Structs
### TokenPermissions
The token and amount details for a transfer signed in the permit transfer signature


```solidity
struct TokenPermissions {
    address token;
    uint256 amount;
}
```

### PermitTransferFrom
The signed permit message for a single token transfer


```solidity
struct PermitTransferFrom {
    TokenPermissions permitted;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 deadline;
}
```

### SignatureTransferDetails
Specifies the recipient address and amount for batched transfers.

*Recipients and amounts correspond to the index of the signed token permissions array.*

*Reverts if the requested amount is greater than the permitted signed amount.*


```solidity
struct SignatureTransferDetails {
    address to;
    uint256 requestedAmount;
}
```

### PermitBatchTransferFrom
Used to reconstruct the signed permit message for multiple token transfers

*Do not need to pass in spender address as it is required that it is msg.sender*

*Note that a user still signs over a spender address*


```solidity
struct PermitBatchTransferFrom {
    TokenPermissions[] permitted;
    uint256 nonce;
    uint256 deadline;
}
```
